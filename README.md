The search engine for case inflections in Polish.

[The running app](https://zenon-frontend.vercel.app/)

The data comes from [kaikki.org](https://kaikki.org/) of [Wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract) project,
that extracted word information from [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/).
I would like to appreciate [Dr. Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org/) for the work in Wiktextract,
as well as anonymous Wiktionary editors, all of who made this project possible.
