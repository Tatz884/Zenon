[The running app]([https://zenon-frontend-k7iefoiuv-tatsuya-hayashis-projects.vercel.app/](https://zenon-frontend-1rshod4do-tatsuya-hayashis-projects.vercel.app/))

The data was based on [Wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract) project, that extracted word information from [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/).
I would like to appreciate [Dr. Tatu Ylonen](https://ylonen.org/) for the work in Wiktextract,
as well as anonymous Wiktionary editors, all of who made this project possible.
